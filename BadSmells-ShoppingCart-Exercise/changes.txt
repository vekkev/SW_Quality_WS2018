Bad Smells found:

+ Unnecessary comments (Article.java, ShoppingCart.java)
    -> Treatment: remove unnecessary comments

+ Public variables
    -> Treatment: made variables private
                  added getter/setter for variables

+ For loop (ShoppingCart.java)
    -> Treatment: change into for each
                  use StringBuilder instead of string concatenation inside a loop

+ fixed code through "Inspect Code" function from IntelliJ

+ Temporary field
    -> Treatment: extract class - created separate classes for Book, CD, DVD
                  which inherited from Article
                  adapted the ShoppingCart Test

+ Switch-Case
    -> Treatment: the output generation is extracted in a toString method in the separated classes
                  the output generation is extracted in a toXML method in the separated classes

+ Public Access at ArrayList (ShoppingCart.java)
    -> Treatment: set ArrayList to private and added "add method" to the ShoppingCart class
                  to gain access from outside

+ Bad Name Convention (Article.java)
    -> Treatment: set String string to String description
