Bad Smells found:

+ fixed code through "Inspect Code" function from IntelliJ

+ Temporary field  -> Treatment: extract class - created separate classes for Book, CD, DVD
                    which inherited from Article
                    adapted the ShoppingCart Test

+ Switch-Case           -> Treatment: the output generation is extracted in a toString method in the separated classes
(toString and toXML)                  the output generation is extracted in a toXML method in the separated classes

+ Public Access at ArrayList -> Treatment: set ArrayList to private and added "add method" to the ShoppingCart class
                                            to gain access from outside

+ Bad Name Convention (class article Line 9) ->Treatment: set String string to String description
